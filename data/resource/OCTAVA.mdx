A semi-automated software tool developed in MATLAB, designed as a stand-alone application  with an intuitive graphical user interface (GUI).
It leverages advanced image processing techniques, including the Frangi vesselness filter and the Fuzzy C-means algorithm, to perform vessel segmentation.
The toolbox generates a range of microvascular metrics, including seven metrics for the entire image or selected subregions, and six specific metrics for characterizing the foveal avascular zone (FAZ).
OCTAVA offers two distinct operating modes: a single-image processing mode for individual analyses and a batch processing mode for handling multiple images simultaneously, all with minimal user input.
In both modes, the software follows the same image processing workflow to ensure consistency.
The software provides users with a comprehensive set of outputs, including binarized, skeletonized, and FAZ-segmented images, allowing for visual inspection of the analysis results.
Quantitative metrics are saved in an Excel file, making it easy for users to access and further analyse the raw data.
