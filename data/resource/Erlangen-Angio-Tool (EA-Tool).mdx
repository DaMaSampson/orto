A semi-automated tool coded in Matlab and designed as stand-alone software with a graphical user interface.
The software applies the Frangi vesselness filter and Otsu thresholding algorithm for vessel segmentation.
After uploading the OCTA image, the user marks the centre of the macular region.
It helps to divide the image into 11 sub-regions for analysis.
The software delivers microvascular metrics such as vessel area density and foveal avascular zone area.
