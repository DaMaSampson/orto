OMIM is a comprehensive, authoritative compendium of human genes and genetic phenotypes that is freely available and updated daily.
The full-text, referenced overviews in OMIM contain information on all known mendelian disorders and over 16,000 genes.
OMIM focuses on the relationship between phenotype and genotype.
It is updated daily, and the entries contain copious links to other genetics resources.
This database was initiated in the early 1960s by Dr. Victor A. McKusick as a catalog of mendelian traits and disorders, entitled Mendelian Inheritance in Man (MIM).
