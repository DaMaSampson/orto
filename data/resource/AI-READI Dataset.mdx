A dataset consisting of data collected from individuals with and without Type 2 Diabetes Mellitus (T2DM) and harmonized across 3 data collection sites.
The composition of the dataset was designed with future studies using AI/Machine Learning in mind.
This included recruitment sampling procedures aimed at achieving approximately equal distribution of participants across sex, race, and diabetes severity,
as well as the design of a data acquisition protocol across multiple domains (survey data, physical measurements, clinical data, imaging data, wearable device data, etc.)
to enable downstream AI/ML analyses that may not be feasible with existing data sources such as claims or electronic health records data.
