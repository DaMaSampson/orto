**Open Research Tools for Ophthalmology** is an initiative to promote reproducibility in ophthalmic research.
The objective is to encourage collaborations across institutions and the development of multi-site projects that will lead to standardised imaging protocols, data analysis methods, and finding reporting in the ophthalmic field.

We aim to establish a repository of data analysis software, ophthalmic images, and protocols towards standardising methods between instruments and across different institutions, with the overall goal of supporting new knowledge generation about ocular diseases and identifying the best biomarkers for early diagnosis, monitoring of progression, and response to treatments in retinal disease.
Please note that we are not able to validate all existing resources; therefore, the user has to validate the usefulness of available resources for research.
