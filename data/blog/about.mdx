**Open Research Tools for Ophthalmology** is an initiative to promote open science and reproducibility in eye research.
ORTO, the Italian word for a vegetable garden, is a powerful metaphor for promoting open science in eye research.
The garden of open science represents an ecosystem where open exchange, collaboration, best practice, and the pooling of resources lead to richer, more sustainable outcomes.
Just as a garden flourishes when it is nurtured and all the elements it needs are accessible, open science accelerates progress by making scientific knowledge freely available, enabling the fruits of discovery to grow and evolve through shared effort and transparency.

ORTO aims to encourage collaborations across institutions and the development of multi-site projects that will lead to standardised imaging protocols, data analysis methods, and reporting of findings in ophthalmology.
To support it, we aim to establish a repository of data analysis software, ophthalmic images, and protocols towards standardising methods between instruments and across institutions, with the overall goal of supporting new knowledge generation on ocular diseases and identifying the best biomarkers for early diagnosis, monitoring of ocular disease progression, and response to treatments.
We also provide a list of peer-reviewed, highly cited papers and papers covering unique topics to equip newcomers with the knowledge needed to understand and utilise open science in eye.
